This project demonstrates scanning and enumeration techniques used in cybersecurity to fingerprint hosts, services, and operating systems on a simulated enterprise network (MegaQuagga).

Tools Used
- Nmap
- Windows Firewall
- Linux Command Line (CLI)
  What I Did
- Performed live host discovery using ping sweeps and Nmap.
- Fingerprinted operating systems, open ports, and running services.
- Implemented countermeasures such as:
  - Disabling vulnerable SMB versions
  - Configuring host-based firewalls
- Created a full Configuration Management Database (CMDB) including:
  - IP addresses
  - Endpoints
  - Network devices
